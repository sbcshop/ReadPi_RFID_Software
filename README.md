### Interfacing Details
  | Pico W | Hardware Pin | Function |
  |---|---|---|
  |GP2 | SCLK | Clock pin of SPI interface for microSD card |
  |GP3 | DIN  | MOSI (Master OUT Slave IN) data pin of SPI interface for microSD card|
  |GP4 | DOUT | MISO (Master IN Slave OUT) data pin of SPI interface for microSD card|
  |GP5 | CS   | Chip Select pin of SPI interface for microSD card|
  |GP22 | Buzzer| Buzzer PWM pin connection|

Note: When SD card not connected, then above related pins can be used for normal GPIO operations.


### 1. Step to install boot Firmware
   - Every ReadPi board will be provided with boot firmware already installed, so you can skip this step and directly go to step 2.
   - If in case you want to install firmware for your board, Push and hold the BOOTSEL button and plug your Pico W into the USB port of your computer. Release the BOOTSEL button after your Pico is connected.

   - It will mount as a Mass Storage Device called RPI-RP2.
   - Drag and drop the MicroPython UF2 - [ReadPi_firmware](https://github.com/sbcshop/ReadPi_RFID_Software/blob/main/ReadPi_Firmware.uf2) file provided in this github onto the RPI-RP2 volume. Your Pico will reboot. You are now running MicroPython on ArdiPi.

### 2. Onboard LED Blink 
   - Download **Thonny IDE** from [Download link](https://thonny.org/) as per your OS and install it.
   - Once done start **Thonny IDE application**, Connect ReadPi to laptop/PC.
   - Select device at the bottom right with a suitable COM port, as shown in the below figure. You might get a different COM port.

      <img src= "https://github.com/sbcshop/EnkPi_2.9_Software/blob/main/images/img2.jpg" />
      
   - Write simple onboard blink Python code or [Download Led blink code](https://github.com/sbcshop/ReadPi_RFID_Software/blob/main/examples/onboard_ledBlink.py), then click on the green run button to make your script run on ReadPi.

     Now that we've reached this point, you're executing your script through Thonny IDE, so if you unplug Pico, it will stop running. To runÂ your script without using an IDE, simply power up ArdiPi and it should run your script, go to step 3. Once you have transferred your code to the ArdiPi board, to see your script running, just plug in power either way using micro USB or via Vin, both will work.

### 3. How to move your script on Pico W of ReadPi
   - Click on File -> Save Copy -> select Raspberry Pi Pico , Then save file as main.py
     
      <img src="https://github.com/sbcshop/3.2_Touchsy_Pico_W_Resistive_Software/blob/main/images/transfer_script_pico.gif" />
   
      In similar way you can add various python code files to Pico. Also you can try out sample codes given here in [examples folder](https://github.com/sbcshop/ReadPi_RFID_Software/tree/main/examples). 
   
   - But in case if you want to move multiple files at one go, example suppose you are interested to save library files folder into Pico W, below image demonstrate that
     
      <img src="https://github.com/sbcshop/3.2_Touchsy_Pico_W_Capacitive_Software/blob/main/images/multiple_file_transfer.gif" />
   
**NOTE: Don't rename _lib_ files** or and other files, only your main code script should be rename as main.py for standalone execution without Thonny.


### Example Codes
   Save whatever example code file you want to try as **main.py** in **Pico W** as shown in above [step 3](), also add related lib files with default name.
   In [example](https://github.com/sbcshop/ReadPi_RFID_Software/blob/main/examples) folder you will find demo example script code to test onboard components of ReadPi like 
   - [Buzzer test](https://github.com/sbcshop/ReadPi_RFID_Software/blob/main/examples/BuzzerDemo.py) : code to test onboard Buzzer
   - [SD card demo](https://github.com/sbcshop/ReadPi_RFID_Software/blob/main/examples/sdcardDemo.py) : code to test onboard micro SD card interfacing, [sdcard.py]() lib file is required for the code to run successfully.
   - [RFID module demo]() : testing onboard RFID module , buzzer and display unit of shield. 
   
   Using this sample code as a guide, you can modify, build, and share codes!!
